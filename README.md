## Sub Heading

My first day on GitHub. 
Today I learned that **version control** is an essential part of my career
as web developer.
Here're some keywords: 
- git
- GitHub
- version control
- repository
- commit
- [ ] hash

> The next three month will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things
every day.

Thanks to [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) for this great invention!
